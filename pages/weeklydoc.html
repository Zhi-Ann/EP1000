                    <h3>Week 1</h3>
                    <p>In week 1, we first learnt how to create a basic website using html. One cool thing that i learnt was how to change the file extension by going to "file explorer options" and deselect the "Hide extensions for known file type",i find it really cool as i get to know more about different types of file extensions e.g. PNG, JPEG , PDF,MP3,MP4 and how to play around with it. We were also given a rough idea of how programming works where the HTML serves as a base for creating the website, CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) (CSS) for enhancing the appearance of the website, Javascript which makes HTML function better.We were told to watch a video "<b>Learn HTML in 12 Minutes</b>" which will help us create our first website. </p>

                    <h3>Week 2</h3>
                    <p>In week 2,The lecturer told use to watch a video "<b>Learn CSS in 12 Minutes</b>" which will help us design our HTML website better,we were also instructed to create a account on Github so that our website that we created can be uploaded and made public.At first i found github to be confusing as i wasn't familar with the website and do not know how to use it, i also didn't really understand the meaning of repository and other jargons.Hence, i would watch simple videos which explains to me the basics of programme and the meaning of the terms used in programming to get a better sense of idea.This week was pretty chill as well, just getting familar with the softwares and website etc.</p>

                     <h3>Week 3</h3>
                    <p>In week 3, i found myself to be spending alot of time working on CSS and HTML.With the help of the video "Learn CSS in 12 Minutes" i sucessfully linked css to html and uploaded my folders to github and made the website public! As i continued to refine my CSS work, i found that no matter what change i made to a part of my css style sheet, the html just doesn't seem to respond at all, i spent around 3hours typing & watching videos to try to resolve this issue and eventually, i found that it was due to a tiny error where the case letter of my first alphabet was different, which causes the changes made to be unlinked due to case-sensitivity.When i realised it i felt so stupid but i learnt that in coding,eveything that you type meant something, hence it made me more aware of whatever i try to add to my coding. </p>
                    
                    <h3>Week 4</h3>
                    <p>In week 4, i learned how to use 3 softwares: <B>GIMP, Inkscape & Fusion 360</B>.The softwares GIMP & Inkscape is used to edit 2D pictures but they vary based on their graphics. Gimp uses <b>raster images</b>(Pixelated based) which is good for more detailed graphics while Inkscape uses <b>vector images</b>(made up of points, lines, and curves etc) which means that the image remains smooth regardless of me zooming in/out.</p>

                    <P>Picture left:Original(PNG), Picture right: Edited(SVG)<br> Software: Inkscape </P>
                    <P>To convert picture format to SVG on Inkscape, click on "path, select "Trace bitmap" and once you choosed your options, press "ok" and save the new image as a SVG file option. <b>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)</b> images are created by parts which is vector based,it has a better resolution than PNG(pixelated), therefore it is more preferred.</P>
                    
                    <p>I also learnt how to used <b>fusion 360</b> which is a software to design 3D models to design a keychain. I did so by doing a <u>sketch</u> of the shape and dimensions of the keychain, once i'm done with sketching, i <u>extrude</u> the sketch to make a 3D structure.</p>
                    
                    <img src="../images/keychain.png" width="500px">
                    <p>Hence, this week i learned how to use these softwares to edit/create 2D images and 3D models by applying the skills of <u>Computer Aided Design (CAD).</u></p>
